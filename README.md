## Introduction

This is a simple implementation of the classic word guessing game, Hangman, written in Python. 

This project was created as a learning exercise to practice fundamental Python programming concepts such as:

- String manipulation: Working with strings to display the word, guess letters, and check for matches.
- Input/output: Taking user input for guesses and providing feedback.
- Conditional statements: Determining game outcomes based on correct and incorrect guesses.
- Loops: Iterating over the game until a win or loss condition is met.

Feel free to explore the code, make improvements, or use it as a starting point for your own Python projects.
