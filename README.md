## Introduction

This is a simple implementation of the classic word guessing game, Hangman, written in Python. 

This project was created as a learning exercise to practice fundamental Python programming concepts such as:

- String manipulation: Working with strings to display the word, guess letters, and check for matches.
- Input/output: Taking user input for guesses and providing feedback.
- Conditional statements: Determining game outcomes based on correct and incorrect guesses.
- Loops: Iterating over the game until a win or loss condition is met.

### Installing

To download the project, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mayara-canaver/jogo-da-forca.git
```

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### How to Play?

Run the following command in terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

Play directly in your terminal, using your keyboard to guess letters.

Feel free to explore the code, make improvements, or use it as a starting point for your own Python projects.
